Here's a quick guide on using Discord and YouTube to participate in our 100% Digital conference! 

## Get a Ticket

You'll need to register at [EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/devopsdays-texas-tickets-132588572991) to get a ticket. We will never sell your contact information to a third party. When you receive the "ticket" from EventBrite, it will have instructions on connecting to Discord and the link to the YouTube channel. 

## YouTube

Keynotes, talks, panels, and other content will be streamed via YouTube. The link to the YouTube channel will be provided in the Eventbrite Email. 

## Discord

Participation--including the hallway track, discussion, OpenSpaces, Party Games, and Sponsor Rooms--are hosted in Discord. Discord provides both video and chat interaction.

You will need to download and install [The Discord Client](https://discord.com/), register for a Discord Account, and join the conference Discord Server via the link provided in the Eventbrite email. 

### Hallway Track

Please feel free to chat with your fellow conference attendees in the Grand Hall and Watercooler channels. Sponsors are available in their rooms to demonstrate their products. 

### OpenSpaces

One of the features we've all missed the most during the past year has been the free-form conversations and user-driven nature of [OpenSpaces](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/open-space), part of the "unconferences" format. We'll be using Discord and several other tools to run a Digital OpenSpaces! Learn more in the #openspaces-thunderdome channel on Discord.
